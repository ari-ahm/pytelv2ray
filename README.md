## Universal Proxy Scanner

This tool scans configured Telegram groups for proxy links, tests them with `xray-knife`, stores results in SQLite, and can optionally upload the best servers to a GitHub repository as a subscription file.

## Features

- **Proxy harvesting from Telegram**: Extracts `vless`, `vmess`, `ss`, `ssr`, and `trojan` URIs.
- **Asynchronous pipeline**: Non-blocking I/O with `asyncio` and `aiosqlite`.
- **Latency and selective speed tests**: Uses `xray-knife` for both latency checks and optional speed tests. You can override the latency test URL via `xray_knife.latency_url` (passed as `-u`).
- **Persistence and curation**: Keeps historical results, caps servers per location, and retries failed links.
- **Progress-aware scanning**: Tracks last processed message per group to avoid reprocessing.
- **Internal proxy support**: Can route Telegram collection through your own tested servers from the database.
- **Link renaming**: Automatically adds location emojis and timestamps to uploaded links.
- **Spam detection**: Identifies and deprioritizes proxy links that return a 403 status code from a target URL.
- **Optional GitHub upload**: Updates or creates a repo file with the final subscription content. Set `github_repo.upload_base64` to true if you need to store base64 content; otherwise raw text is uploaded.
- **Graceful shutdown**: Safely interrupts long-running tasks on SIGINT/SIGTERM.
- **Log rotation**: Optional log file rotation to prevent disk space issues.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Packages (installed via `requirements.txt`):
  - `telethon`
  - `aiosqlite`
  - `PyGithub`
  - `PySocks`
  - `requests`
  - `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio` (for tests)
- External binary: `xray-knife` (see below)

## Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## External binary: xray-knife

- Download from the releases page: `https://github.com/lilendian0x00/xray-knife/releases`
- Extract the executable and make sure it is executable (`chmod +x xray-knife` on Linux/macOS).
- Set `xray_knife.path` in `config.json` to the executable path. Example: `"./xray-knife/xray-knife"`.

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` with your values. Example:

```json
{
  "telegram": {
    "api_id": 1234567,
    "api_hash": "YOUR_API_HASH",
    "session_name": "my_telegram_session",
    "target_groups": [-1001234567890],
    "fetch_chunk_size": 200,
    "proxy": {
      "enabled": false,
      "scheme": "socks5",
      "hostname": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 9050
    }
  },
  "xray_knife": {
    "path": "./xray-knife/xray-knife",
    "test_args": ["-t", "20"],
    "latency_url": "https://developers.google.com"
  },
  "internal_proxy": {
    "enabled": false,
    "selector": "speed_passed",
    "max_links": 1,
    "listen_host": "127.0.0.1",
    "listen_port": 1080,
    "xray_knife_args": []
  },
  
  "speed_test": {
    "enabled": true,
    "min_download_mbps": 5.0,
    "max_candidates_per_location": 3
  },
  "github_repo": {
    "enabled": true,
    "github_token": "YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "owner": "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME",
    "repo": "YOUR_REPO_NAME",
    "file_path": "path/to/subscription.txt",
    "commit_message": "Update proxy subscription",
    "upload_base64": false
  },
  "logging": {
    "level": "INFO",
    "file": "scanner.log",
    "rotate": {
      "enabled": true,
      "max_bytes": 5242880,
      "backup_count": 3
    }
  },
  "database": {
    "path": "servers.db",
    "retest_window_hours": 6,
    "max_retries": 3,
    "max_servers_per_location": 10
  }
}
```

Notes:
- `telegram.api_hash` must be set (the app validates this and will exit if it is a placeholder).
- `xray_knife.path` must point to the actual executable (the app validates it with your system PATH). If the file is inside a folder like `xray-knife/xray-knife`, set that exact path.
- `speed_test.min_download_mbps` filters out servers below this threshold when selecting best per location.
- GitHub token can be set via `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable as fallback.
- `logging.cleanup_xray_knife_dir`: Set to `true` to automatically delete the `~/.xray-knife` directory on shutdown. This directory may be used by `xray-knife` for its own database or cache. Defaults to `false`. Use with caution.

## How it works

1. **Optional internal proxy**: If enabled, starts a local SOCKS5 proxy using the best servers from your database.
2. **Collect messages**: Fetch recent messages from all configured Telegram groups and extract proxy links.
3. **Latency testing**: Run `xray-knife` latency tests (optionally using `latency_url`) on new links plus eligible retries; persist results and HTTP codes in SQLite.
4. **403-aware selection**: Servers with HTTP 403 are deprioritized.
5. **Speed testing**: Optionally select top latency-passed candidates per location (non-403 preferred) and run speed tests; persist results and pick the best per location.
6. **Link renaming**: Add location emojis and timestamps to the final links, and a ðŸš« suffix for 403 servers.
7. **GitHub upload**: If enabled, upload the subscription file to the configured GitHub repo.

### Internal Proxy Feature

When `internal_proxy.enabled` is true, the app will:
- Pick one or more of the best links from the database (by `selector`) and start an `xray-knife` local SOCKS5 proxy.
- Route Telegram collection through this local proxy instead of direct connection or the configured proxy.

Config options:
- `selector`: `speed_passed` (download desc) or `latency_passed` (delay asc)
- `max_links`: number of links to feed to the internal proxy
- `listen_host` / `listen_port`: where the local SOCKS5 listens
- `xray_knife_args`: extra CLI flags passed to `xray-knife proxy` (advanced)

### 403 Handling

- The `xray-knife` CSV output includes a `code` column. The app stores it as `servers.http_code`.
- If the HTTP code is 403 during testing, that server is considered likely spam-blocked.
- Selection queries prefer non-403 servers over 403 ones.
- Final link remarks include a ðŸš« emoji when the last recorded code was 403.

### Link Renaming

Links uploaded to GitHub are automatically renamed with:
- **Location emoji** (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, etc.)
- **Location name**
- **Last tested timestamp** (URL encoded)

Example: `vless://.../path#%F0%9F%87%BA%F0%9F%87%B8%20United%20States%20%7C%20Tested%3A%202025-01-15%2014%3A30`

## Run

```bash
python app.py
```

On first run, Telethon will prompt for your phone number, login code, and 2FA (if enabled) to create the `.session` file.

Logs are written to `scanner.log` by default; optional rotation can be enabled via `logging.rotate`.

## Scheduling (optional)

Use cron/systemd to run periodically. Example crontab entry (every 30 minutes):

```cron
*/30 * * * * cd /path/to/project && /path/to/python app.py >> scanner.log 2>&1
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Config error**: Ensure `config.json` is valid JSON and required fields are not placeholders.
- **`xray-knife binary not found`**: Verify `xray_knife.path` points to an executable and is accessible (use an absolute path if needed).
- **GitHub upload failures**: Check token permissions (repo scope), repository name/owner, and that the file path is correct.
- **Internal proxy fails**: Ensure you have speed/latency-tested servers in the database before enabling.
- **Large log files**: Enable log rotation in config to prevent disk space issues.
- **`xray-knife` issues after running**: If `xray-knife` seems to lose its history or configuration, check if you have enabled `logging.cleanup_xray_knife_dir`. This option, disabled by default, removes the `~/.xray-knife` directory on shutdown.
